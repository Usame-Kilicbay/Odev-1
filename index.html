    <p>
      Imma self-taught game developer. I worked for a startup as a hyper-casual
      game developer for six months. I left the job because I wanted to see
      other opportunities. I have shipped a few small games of my own. Now I’m
      working on a Game Kit named Sidekick, also learning HTML, CSS and PHP
      (because I’m also interested in web development). I’m interested in tool
      programming for Unity.
